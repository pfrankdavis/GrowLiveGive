        <h3>Jim Davis, <em>Financial Advisor</em></h3>
        <p>As you are searching for a Financial Advisor to assist you, I thought you ought to know why I humbly, yet confidently, want to be your choice!</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="team-ul">Although I left the education industry and have been working as an independent financial advisor for over 15 years, I still enjoy teaching clients about investments.  My goal is to make sure you understand options in order to make wise decisions with your money.</li>
          <li class="team-ul">Independence as an advisor adds reassuring objectivity.  This means, in part, that we do not have any of our own investments to sell or sales quotas to meet. I, along with our investment research team, search the marketplace to find appropriate investments to use in client account management. That means I am free to have the best interest of each and every client in mind. </li>
          <li class="team-ul">I have a team in place to assist me in serving you. Whether your need is for individual/family financial planning, a retirement plan for your company or a complex estate plan, we can service your needs.  </li>
          <li class="team-ul">I love puzzles! I believe the basics of financial planning includes taking all of your financial “puzzle pieces” and fitting them together to see if any pieces are missing or need to be reconfigured. I help you plan with the long term in mind and we do so in layman’s terms. I utilize a user-friendly financial planning program called RetireUp to assist with this. The better I understand you and the better you comprehend your needs and goals, the stronger our relationship will become. Relationship is the key!</li>
          <li class="team-ul">Nobody has arrived at perfection yet. Everyone can improve. That’s why we continue to <b>Grow Live Give</b>.</li>
        </ul>
